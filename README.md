# Conway's Game of Life
An implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in Java. It is neither complete nor well written, I was bored and it is currently 05:15 AM. Some of the buttons aren't implemented yet, and there are a few things I want to redesign when I am less tired.

## Purpose
There isn't one. I was bored.

## Building
This project uses Maven. 

```
git clone https://github.com/LMBishop/game-of-life/
cd game-of-life
mvn package
```

Your new jar should be in `target/`.

```
java -jar target/game-of-life-<VERSION>.jar
```
